/*************************************************************************
Subroutine for finding the tridiagonal matrix eigenvalues/vectors in a
given half-interval (A, B] by using bisection and inverse iteration.

Input parameters:
    D       -   the main diagonal of a tridiagonal matrix.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
    E       -   the secondary diagonal of a tridiagonal matrix.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-2].
    N       -   size of matrix, N>=0.
    ZNeeded -   flag controlling whether the eigenvectors are needed or not.
                If ZNeeded is equal to:
                 * 0, the eigenvectors are not needed;
                 * 1, the eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix are multiplied
                   by the square matrix Z. It is used if the tridiagonal
                   matrix is obtained by the similarity transformation
                   of a symmetric matrix.
                 * 2, the eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix replace matrix Z.
    A, B    -   half-interval (A, B] to search eigenvalues in.
    Z       -   if ZNeeded is equal to:
                 * 0, Z isn't used and remains unchanged;
                 * 1, Z contains the square matrix (array whose indexes range
                   within [0..N-1, 0..N-1]) which reduces the given symmetric
                   matrix to tridiagonal form;
                 * 2, Z isn't used (but changed on the exit).

Output parameters:
    D       -   array of the eigenvalues found.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..M-1].
    M       -   number of eigenvalues found in the given half-interval (M>=0).
    Z       -   if ZNeeded is equal to:
                 * 0, doesn't contain any information;
                 * 1, contains the product of a given NxN matrix Z (from the
                   left) and NxM matrix of the eigenvectors found (from the
                   right). Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..M-1].
                 * 2, contains the matrix of the eigenvectors found.
                   Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..M-1].

Result:

    True, if successful. In that case, M contains the number of eigenvalues
    in the given half-interval (could be equal to 0), D contains the eigenvalues,
    Z contains the eigenvectors (if needed).
    It should be noted that the subroutine changes the size of arrays D and Z.

    False, if the bisection method subroutine wasn't able to find the
    eigenvalues in the given interval or if the inverse iteration subroutine
    wasn't able to find all the corresponding eigenvectors. In that case,
    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not returned, M is equal to 0.
