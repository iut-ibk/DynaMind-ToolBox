#JoinDataStream
The module joins the content of the user defined data streams to a leading stream. The leading stream is the stream connected with the Combined port. New systems to joint the leading stream can be added by double clicking on the module. The added system (in the figure Topo) shows up as new port at the module. The name of the port is not important, the content of the linked stream is joint to the combined stream (in the figure Topology)
